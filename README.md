# HR Analytics - Employee Attrition & Performance


A Data Science Project focused on analyze and predict which employees has more
probability of leaving the company.

Recruiting the perfect candidate for a position in the company or even retaining 
the most talented employees is very important for companies, as the hiring process is 
costly and takes time. So if a company has a talented employee, it needs to be kept in
the company, for example, offering more benefits or some types of bonuses. Because if 
this employee wants to leave the company, a lot of money will be spent in the process 
of hiring a new employee. How to advertise vacancies in the communication channels; 
hiring consultants; telephony expenses; time that managers take in hiring; opportunity
cost for business and/or results not carried out in the period; cost of training and 
integration of the professional (either hours or direct costs), etc.


## Project

- `Human-Resource-Analytics`
    - `Frontend`
    - `Backend`
        - `api`
        - `data`
        - `models`
    - `Notebooks` 

The project is divided into tree main directories. The `Frontend` is a React Js 
application with Material Design System, the `Backend` contain the `api` subfolder, 
which holds the Python code to connect Frontend with Backend. The `data` subfolder 
holds the data used in this project, and `models` contain all the .pkl files of the 
Machine Learning models trained and evaluated.

Finally, `Notebooks` contain the .ipynb file, in which there is all the Data Science 
Project steps.

## Apprenticeship

I learned more about the knowledge domain explored in this project, as much as the
technical technologies used for Data Science Project steps and the fullstack development
of the application.
